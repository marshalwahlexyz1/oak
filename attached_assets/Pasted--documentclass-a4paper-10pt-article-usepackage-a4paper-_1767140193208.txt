\section*{Professional Summary}
PhD candidate specializing in AI-driven risk modeling and fraud detection systems for consumer financial services. Research combines Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and probabilistic modeling to detect complex fraud patterns across digital platforms. Experience includes building ML-powered compliance verification systems, cross-platform fraud detection architectures, and automated risk assessment tools. Proven track record of translating cutting-edge research into real-world impact—work led to removal of 100M+ install predatory financial apps from Google Play. Seeking to apply expertise in machine learning, financial fraud detection, and ethical AI to JPMorgan's Consumer \& Community Banking Risk Modeling challenges.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em, topsep=2pt, itemsep=1pt]
  \item \textbf{Project: Cross-Platform Fraud Detection via Probabilistic State Modeling and Deep Learning}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Developing fraud detection system combining Hidden Markov Models with \textbf{fine-tuned LLMs} (DeBERTa) to track pig-butchering scams (\$5.8-9.2B annual losses) through five conversation states using Bayesian belief tracking, directly applicable to sequential credit risk and fraud modeling.
    \item Engineering cross-platform state handoff protocol maintaining detection continuity when fraudsters pivot between messaging apps, addressing multi-channel fraud in omnichannel banking ecosystems.
    \item Building multi-label trigger classifier leveraging LLM embeddings with state-dependent risk scoring to identify psychological manipulation tactics across conversation stages.
    \item Collecting IRB-approved dataset across 7 emerging markets with hierarchical annotations to train culturally robust models; applying Monte Carlo simulation for adversarial testing and ensuring regulatory-compliant model interpretability.


\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Project: The Cost of Convenience: Identifying, Analyzing, and Mitigating Predatory Loan Applications on Android (Accepted at ACM AsiaCCS 2026)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Engineered an end-to-end security assessment pipeline to audit digital lending apps across 5 countries against national regulations and Google's Financial Services Policy, processing and analyzing hundreds of applications at scale.
        \item Implemented LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping to translate legal requirements into testable security checks, combining static analysis (Androguard, FlowDroid), dynamic testing, and network traffic inspection to detect non-compliance.
        \item Performed responsible disclosure to Google, leading to the removal of 93 predatory apps (300M+ cumulative installs) that were exfiltrating sensitive user data without consent—demonstrating impact at platform scale.
